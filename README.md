# Kids Reporter iOS App

An iPad-native app designed for children to go on "reporting" missions with three distinct phases: reporting, production, and distribution.

## App Overview

The Kids Reporter app is structured around three main phases:

1. **Reporting Phase**: Interactive notebook sketching with collapsible camera recording and automatic interview transcription
2. **Production Phase**: Drag-and-drop video editor with PowerPoint-like frame builder
3. **Distribution Phase**: Safe sharing limited to iPhoto shared albums and Messages (no external platforms)

## Features

- **Privacy-First Design**: Child safety is paramount with no external sharing platforms
- **iPad-Optimized UI**: Large touch targets and intuitive gestures designed for young users
- **Accessibility Features**: Clear visual hierarchy and child-appropriate interface design
- **Split-Screen Interface**: Notebook sketching alongside camera recording in reporting phase

## Technical Stack

- **Platform**: iOS 17.0+ (iPad only)
- **Language**: Swift with SwiftUI
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern
- **Key Frameworks**:
  - SwiftUI for modern declarative UI
  - PencilKit for drawing and sketching
  - AVFoundation for camera and video recording
  - Speech recognition for automatic transcription

## Development Toolchain

This project uses a modern, CLI-friendly development workflow:

### Project Management

- **XcodeGen**: YAML-based Xcode project generation instead of traditional `.xcodeproj` files
- **Configuration**: All project settings defined in `project.yml` for version control friendliness
- **Benefits**: Eliminates merge conflicts in binary project files, enables reproducible builds

### Build System

```bash
# Generate Xcode project from YAML configuration
xcodegen generate

# Build for iPad simulator
xcodebuild -project KidsReporter.xcodeproj -scheme KidsReporter \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)' build

# Launch in iPad simulator
xcrun simctl list devices | grep iPad
xcrun simctl boot "iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)"
xcrun simctl install booted ./path/to/app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.example.KidsReporter
```

### File Structure

```

```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   brew install xcodegen
   ```

2. Generate Xcode project:

   ```bash
   xcodegen generate
   ```

3. Open in Xcode or build from command line:
   ```bash
   open KidsReporter.xcodeproj
   ```

## Current Status

âœ… Basic project structure and three-phase navigation
âœ… Reporting phase split-screen UI with collapsible camera panel
âœ… XcodeGen-based project management
âœ… Asset catalog setup with proper iPad configuration
ðŸ”„ PencilKit drawing implementation (placeholder ready)
ðŸ”„ AVFoundation camera recording (UI complete, integration pending)
â­• Speech recognition for transcription
â­• Production phase drag-and-drop video editor
â­• Distribution phase safe sharing features

## Educational Goals

This project serves as a learning exercise for Swift/SwiftUI development, demonstrating:

- Modern iOS app architecture patterns
- Child-safe UI design principles
- CLI-based development workflows
- Integration of multiple iOS frameworks
